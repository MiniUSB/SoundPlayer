SoundPlayer
===========

Play sounds in Minecraft through the Bukkit Server Mod API.
Have you ever wanted to play a sound in Minecraft using the Bukkit API? No? Well too bad, here's the code, anyway.

Commands (that it comes with):

/cathiss Plays the sound CAT_HISS to whoever's name you typed.
How to make your own sound command:

1. Go into your Eclipse Bukkit Project and make a new class

2. Name the class "CommandNameofCommand" (e.g. CommandHurt)

3. Copy and paste the code shown on https://gist.github.com/MiniUSB/b6a7f20867331ecf8847 into it and edit it how it says to edit it above the code.

Enjoy! :)
